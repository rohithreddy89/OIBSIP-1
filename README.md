This GitHub repository hosts the Java project for Oasis Infobyte's Online Examination.

This Java code comprises two classes: `login` and `OnlineTestBegin`, implementing a basic online examination system. The `login` class creates a GUI for user authentication, allowing access to the online test. The `OnlineTestBegin` class facilitates the exam process, presenting questions, recording answers, and managing the timer. The code utilizes Swing components for the user interface and event handling for user interactions. Finally, the `Online_Examination` class serves as the entry point for the application, initiating the login process.
